## Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences
*Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences* is a short course that provides fundamental theories. They share lots of additional reading sources. Some links that I find useful for philosophy of the topic:
- [Evolutionary Psychology](https://iep.utm.edu/evol-psy/)
- [Evolution of Language](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/)
- [Niche Construction](https://nicheconstruction.com)
- [Chimpanzee culture social learning](https://www.livescience.com/48727-chimpanzee-culture-social-learning.html?adbid=10152376199566761&adbpl=fb&adbpr=30478646760&cmpid=514627_20141112_35461417)
- [Language, embodiment, and the cognitive niche](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1449)

- [Overview of philosophical problems concerning consciousness](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/)</br>
#### Limitations of perceptual awareness:

- [Expecting Ourselves?](https://philosophyofbrains.com/2015/12/16/expecting-ourselves.aspx)
- [Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/div-classtitlewhatever-next-predictive-brains-situated-agents-and-the-future-of-cognitive-sciencediv/33542C736E17E3D1D44E8D03BE5F4CD9)
- [Spreading the Joy? Why the Machinery of Consciousness is (Probably) Still in the Head](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/spreading-the-joy-why-the-machinery-of-consciousness-is-probably-)
#### Summary of key points
- According to evolutionary psychology, evolutionary pressures would most likely produce a ‘modular’ mind.
- Language most likely developed through a combination of biological and cultural evolution.
- It is often unclear what "consciousness" means, and we should be careful when using colloquial terms like "consciousness" in science.
- The scientific study of consciousness is concerned with several different phenomena, including attention, wakefulness, and phenomenal experience itself, which are not always connected.

**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** is quite good resource.
#### Computational theory of mind and connectionism
- [Computational Theory of Mind](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/)
- [Connectionism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/)

- [Embodied Cognition](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/)
- [McGeer and Passive Dynamic Bipedal Walking (short video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOPED7I5Lac)
- [Cornell robots: all are autonomous, use little or no power and can't stand with parallel legs](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/robots/)
#### Summary of key points
- Cognition doesn't have to be just "in the head" - cognitive processing can be supported or complemented by bodily and environmental resources.
- Simple behaviors (like moving around an environment) are often driven by perception and don't necessarily require something like a clear plan or goal.
- When we take into account the role played by our cultural and linguistic environment, 'bodily' explanations of computing can scale up to higher (human) cognition.
