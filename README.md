# Cognitive Neuroscience

I'm keeping this repository for those who are afraid to start neuroscience or something else because it seems dark, comprehensive, and complex, even though it interests them a lot. I'm at the same point, and let's see how far we can go with self-discipline.

## About my passion
As can be easily seen, I have no past study on neuroscience. However, it has been my dream for a long time to explore the brain, understand cognitive processes and contribute something to this field. To prepare for this, I tried to improve myself in subjects related to my field at university. For example, "Object Recognition", "Attention", and "Language" topics in cognitive neuroscience can be considered as computer vision and natural language processing from machines' (AI's) terminological perspective. As a long term goal, I will develop artificial intelligence-based projects with having clear understanding of the neuroscience domain's problems and needs, by learning and combining the biological and psychological approaches. While I think that deep learning and new technologies can play an important role in the discovery of the brain, I rolled up my sleeves to learn traditional methods as well. I wake up every day with a different excitement for the new things I will learn because there are lots of unknown things that I want to solve, which is very interesting and I like in this field. 

*How the brain works is simply fascinating.*

#### Summary of key points
- According to evolutionary psychology, evolutionary pressures would most likely produce a ‘modular’ mind.
- Language most likely developed through a combination of biological and cultural evolution.
- It is often unclear what "consciousness" means, and we should be careful when using colloquial terms like "consciousness" in science.
- The scientific study of consciousness is concerned with several different phenomena, including attention, wakefulness, and phenomenal experience itself, which are not always connected.

**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** is quite good resource.

- [Cornell robots: all are autonomous, use little or no power and can't stand with parallel legs](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/robots/)
#### Summary of key points
- Cognition doesn't have to be just "in the head" - cognitive processing can be supported or complemented by bodily and environmental resources.
- Simple behaviors (like moving around an environment) are often driven by perception and don't necessarily require something like a clear plan or goal.
- When we take into account the role played by our cultural and linguistic environment, 'bodily' explanations of computing can scale up to higher (human) cognition.

### Cognitive Neuroscience The Biology of the Mind

Thomas Willis first introduced us, in the mid 1600s, to the idea that damage to the brain could influence behavior and that the cerebral cortex might indeed be the seat of what makes us human. Phrenologists expanded on this idea and developed a localizationist view of the brain. Gall's interesting approach Phrenology is a theory of human behavior based upon the belief that an individual's character and mental faculties correlate with the shape of their head. He has a story with Napoleon, check [that](https://www.thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/pdf_articles/phrenology.pdf).

Patients like those of Broca and Wernicke later supported the importance of specific brain locations on human behavior (like language -> [Broca's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area), [Redefining the role of Broca's area](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1414491112)). Ramón y Cajal, Sherrington, and Brodmann, among others, provided evidence that although the microarchitecture of distinct brain regions could support a [localizationist](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=80190) view of the brain, these areas are interconnected. 

*Note that: Ramón y Cajal is considered by many to be the father of modern neuroscience for his pioneering research.*

Soon, scientists began to realize that the integration of the brain’s neural networks might be what enables the mind. At the same time that neuroscientists were researching the brain, psychologists were studying the mind, with its thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and so forth. Out of the philosophical theory of empiricism came the idea of [associationism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/associationist-thought/): that any response followed by a reward would be maintained, and that these associations were the basis of how the mind learned. Associationism was the prevailing theory for many years, until Hebb emphasized the biological basis of learning, and Chomsky and Miller realized that associationism couldn’t explain all learning or all actions of the mind.

Neuroscientists and psychologists both reached the conclusion that there is more to the brain than just the sum of its parts, that the brain must enable the mind--but how? The term cognitive neuroscience was coined in the late 1970s because the fields of neuroscience and psychology were once again coming together. Neuroscience was in need of the theories of the psychology of the mind, and psychology was ready for a greater understanding of the working of the brain. The resulting marriage is cognitive neuroscience.

## Diary

### Day 1-2
I completed the course "Philosophy and the Sciences: Introduction to the Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences". It's relatively short and superficial course. They cover the main concepts of brain evolutionary theory and consciousness. After explaining the fundamentals of ideas, they mostly provide external resources for further information. 

### Day 3-6
I started course "Medical Neuroscience". Dr. White is pretty nice teacher, in first week he starts with the long introduction of the course. He recommends Neuroscience 6th book for further information. (It seems really hard to read for me, but anyway, we are in the path.)

I continued my research to find convenient resources for myself to start cognitive neuroscience. I will be updating [Resources](#resources) with my progress.

-----------
I will not be able to share some links due to copyrights, but I will be writing some of the notes I took in the [Notes](#notes) section.

-----------

In the second part of week one, he starts "Neuroanatomy". Frankly, I feel pretty awkward watching this course. We haven't been studying anything biological since we started university, and the language barrier with medical terms puts an extra burden on it. Still, I can say that I understand 60-70% of what is being said, Dr. White explains the topics really well. I completed the week one with lots of questions.

I must say that the course "Medical Neuroscience" is started as one of the most difficult course I have ever taken. However, this difficulty does not reduce my interest, on the contrary, I am even more curious. I research the parts that I think I need to research and leave the rest because some topics are too deep and need to be looked at again later.</br>

I read "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" until page 40s. Then read "Neuroscience 6th" only 5 pages (it took me 2.5 hours to read 5 pages???). I realized that I need to work Neuroscience calmly and without ruining the order. The discipline of neuroscience gives me a much more settled feeling than programming.</br>

I skipped over "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" and started to "Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind". Well, I won't continue to skip. I did this because the second book is much more up-to-date and recommended. I read the holy book "Neuroscience" 10 pages with lots of dictionary checking, searching for unknown biological and medical terms. I understand "patience" is the key...</br></br>


### Day 7
Off-day for cognitive neuroscience.

### Day 8 
I spoke with my professor at the university, who has a PhD in neuroscience. He gave some advice, and I talked to so many people at university today. Couldn't find the time to work.

### Day 9-11
I continue the book Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind. Their explanations of the topics are clear, and they provide several experiments and stories to make it more deducible. The nervous system descriptions are a bit more superficial than the neuroscience book, as expected, but they mention enough for this book.
