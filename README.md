# Cognitive Neuroscience

I'm keeping this repository for those who are afraid to start neuroscience or something else because it seems dark, comprehensive, and complex, even though it interests them a lot. I'm at the same point, and let's see how far we can go with self-discipline.

**Note that:** Neuroscience is more theoretical than cognitive science, however, these both require experimental studies to go further after reaching some level of knowledge, especially for cognitive science. Therefore, in this repository we will be covering most of theoretical background of these studies with lack of experience. I personally want to study cognitive neuroscience at my phd and we need to start from somewhere.

## About my passion
As can be easily seen, I have no past study on neuroscience. However, it has been my dream for a long time to explore the brain, understand cognitive processes and contribute something to this field. To prepare for this, I tried to improve myself in subjects related to my field at university. For example, "Object Recognition", "Attention", and "Language" topics in cognitive neuroscience can be considered as computer vision and natural language processing from machines' (AI's) terminological perspective. As a long term goal, I will develop artificial intelligence-based projects with having clear understanding of the neuroscience domain's problems and needs, by learning and combining the biological and psychological approaches. While I think that deep learning and new technologies can play an important role in the discovery of the brain, I rolled up my sleeves to learn traditional methods as well. I wake up every day with a different excitement for the new things I will learn because there are lots of unknown things that I want to solve, which is very interesting and I like in this field. 

*Brain is simply fascinating.*

## Diary

### Day 1-2
I completed the course "Philosophy and the Sciences: Introduction to the Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences". It's relatively short and superficial course. They cover the main concepts of brain evolutionary theory and consciousness. After explaining the fundamentals of ideas, they mostly provide external resources for further information. 

### Day 3-6
I started course "Medical Neuroscience". Dr. White is pretty nice teacher, in first week he starts with the long introduction of the course. He recommends Neuroscience 6th book for further information. (It seems really hard to read for me, but anyway, we are in the path.)

I continued my research to find convenient resources for myself to start cognitive neuroscience. I will be updating [Resources](#resources) with my progress.

-----------
I will not be able to share some links due to copyrights, but I will be writing some of the notes I took in the [Notes](#notes) section.

-----------

In the second part of week one, he starts "Neuroanatomy". Frankly, I feel pretty awkward watching this course. We haven't been studying anything biological since we started university, and the language barrier with medical terms puts an extra burden on it. Still, I can say that I understand 60-70% of what is being said, Dr. White explains the topics really well. I completed the week one with lots of questions.

I must say that the course "Medical Neuroscience" is started as one of the most difficult course I have ever taken. However, this difficulty does not reduce my interest, on the contrary, I am even more curious. I research the parts that I think I need to research and leave the rest because some topics are too deep and need to be looked at again later.</br>

I read "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" until page 40s. Then read "Neuroscience 6th" only 5 pages (it took me 2.5 hours to read 5 pages???). I realized that I need to work Neuroscience calmly and without ruining the order. The discipline of neuroscience gives me a much more settled feeling than programming.</br>

I skipped over "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" and started to "Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind". Well, I won't continue to skip. I did this because the second book is much more up-to-date and recommended. I read the holy book "Neuroscience" 10 pages with lots of dictionary checking, searching for unknown biological and medical terms. I understand "patience" is the key...</br></br>


### Day 7
Off-day for cognitive neuroscience.

### Day 8 
I spoke with my professor at the university, who has a PhD in neuroscience. He gave some advice, and I talked to so many people at university today. Couldn't find the time to work.

### Day 9-11
I continue the book Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind. Their explanations of the topics are clear, and they provide several experiments and stories to make it more deducible.

### Day 12-13
I learned about the nervous systems. It recalled knowledge that I already have at high school. It is really strange feeling tho. When I was in high school, I was thinking and grumbling like "all of these informations are useless and we will never use". Of course, there are some stuff I see the first time. However, some of the new information were like I have always wondered, but have never made research about it. This chapter (Structure and Function of the Nervous System) is quite satisfying and full of useful information to fill spaces in the mind. I guess this chapter is one of the most technical one, and I think I will be even more enjoyed in other chapters.

### Day 14-18
Off-days for cognitive neuroscience. I am working on 3 different research projects, so I needed to be focused on others. Worked on signal processing and eye-tracking.

### Day 19
I started watching and completed first week of course "Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life". It is lightweight version of Medical Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroscience book. Actually, in this case I repeated same topics for 3 or 4 times from different resources without realising. Anyway, in my opinion it is important to repeat these main vocabulary of neurobiology and cognition to take it in the long-term memory and you can use the same order which is 1) watching course "Medical Neuroscience", 2) reading book and stuff about Cognitive Neuroscience, 3) watching course "Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life". I started feel the knowledge, but also see I still have quuiite looong way to go.

### Day 20-21
I started signal processing for neuroscience, Mike X Cohen's book "Analyzing Neural Time Series Data Theory and Practice" and videos. I am still making literature review for eye-tracking for programming. In 1990, [How do we read algorithms? A case study.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/48797) proposed the analysis of data collected from eye movement to investigate the cognitive process of programmers, based on theories that linked eye fixation to comprehension to understand how programmers read and understand algorithms. I do my research about extraction features of comprehension state from eye-tracking outputs.

### Day 22
Today was the first productive day of my new program. I realised that I cannot keep up with the lots of new knowledge and research projects without restrict plan, so I made one. 

I continued through medical neuroscience course. I finished the part of Cerebral Cortex, Brainstem and Blood Supply, and it was really hard to keep up with. I spent a fair amount of time understanding the locations of the arteries and the brain regions they supply, however, quiz was really hard to pass. I read the part of CNS, and Blood Supply and the Brain from Cognitive Neuroscience book. I watched the next videos of Mike X Cohen's and I start feel to really really enjoy this process. Even though it is painful, I can feel that I learn actual science. I read Mike Cohen's book on signal processing and analysis and repeated what he explained in the videos.

### Day 23-30
Well, in this period, I studied like an actual nerd. I also read the book "atomic habits" recently, so I got some tips to organize my study routine and its effectiveness :) 

Here below is the my current daily routine which I think its quite nice to practice topics over and over again and progress in a solid way. <br/> ( You can feel the knowledge in your veins ): <br/>
1) [5AM - 6AM] -> Reading casual totally normal human book <br/>
2) [6.15AM - 7.30AM] -> Watching Medical Neuroscience or The Neurobiology of Everyday Life course videos <br/>
3) [8AM - 9.30AM] -> Reading/studying Cognitive Neuroscience book <br/>
4) [10AM - 11.30AM] -> Watching neural signal processing and analysis videos <br/>
5) [12 - 1PM] -> Reading/studying neural signal processing book <br/>
6) [2PM - 5PM] -> Flexible duties (job/other research projects etc.)
7) [6PM - 7PM] -> Reading/studying neural signal processing book <br/>

I realized that all materials I study are supporting each other. Neuroanatomy is the most hard topic for me right now, and it definitely requires lots of repetition on same topics to memorize exact location of each nerves, brain regions and functions of whole complex structures. Thus, I think this study plan is quite effective.

In some days, I just could not find any power to study one more hour signal processing from book as last study task. However, it's still okay, we're fine. I am still breathing.

### Day 31-34
I decreased the amount of study, and went to university to socialize and catch up. 
Anyways, I completed 3rd week of Medical Neuroscience and 3rd week of Neurobiology. I am also at middle of the static spectral analysis on Mike Cohen's course.

### After 3 weeks of courses
***About Medical Neuroscience:*** As I mentioned before, it is one of the most comprehensive online course I have ever taken. I learn a lot, I forget a lot, however, it is still quite useful and significant to comprehend how medical side of neuroscience think. This course provides numerous insights about neuroscience. <br/>

***About Neurobiology:*** It cannot be considered as comprehensive if we consider medical neuroscience course load. It includes light-weighted and non-medical aspects of neurobiology. <br/>

### Day 35
I will study IELTS for 3 days. Time for a little break for neuroscience.
