# Cognitive Neuroscience

I'm keeping this repository for those who are afraid to start neuroscience or something else because it seems dark, comprehensive, and complex, even though it interests them a lot. I'm at the same point, and let's see how far we can go with self-discipline.

**Note that:** Neuroscience is more theoretical than cognitive science, however, these both require experimental studies to go further after reaching some level of knowledge, especially for cognitive science. Therefore, in this repository we will be covering most of theoretical background of these studies with lack of experience. I personally want to study cognitive neuroscience at my phd and we need to start from somewhere.

## About my passion
As can be easily seen, I have no past study on neuroscience. However, it has been my dream for a long time to explore the brain, understand cognitive processes and contribute something to this field. To prepare for this, I tried to improve myself in subjects related to my field at university. For example, "Object Recognition", "Attention", and "Language" topics in cognitive neuroscience can be considered as computer vision and natural language processing from machines' (AI's) terminological perspective. As a long term goal, I will develop artificial intelligence-based projects with having clear understanding of the neuroscience domain's problems and needs, by learning and combining the biological and psychological approaches. While I think that deep learning and new technologies can play an important role in the discovery of the brain, I rolled up my sleeves to learn traditional methods as well. I wake up every day with a different excitement for the new things I will learn because there are lots of unknown things that I want to solve, which is very interesting and I like in this field. 

*Brain is simply fascinating.*

- According to evolutionary psychology, evolutionary pressures would most likely produce a ‘modular’ mind.
- Language most likely developed through a combination of biological and cultural evolution.
- It is often unclear what "consciousness" means, and we should be careful when using colloquial terms like "consciousness" in science.
- The scientific study of consciousness is concerned with several different phenomena, including attention, wakefulness, and phenomenal experience itself, which are not always connected.

**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** is quite good resource.

#### Summary of key points
- Cognition doesn't have to be just "in the head" - cognitive processing can be supported or complemented by bodily and environmental resources.
- Simple behaviors (like moving around an environment) are often driven by perception and don't necessarily require something like a clear plan or goal.
- When we take into account the role played by our cultural and linguistic environment, 'bodily' explanations of computing can scale up to higher (human) cognition.

## Cognitive Neuroscience The Biology of the Mind

### A Brief History of Cognitive Neuroscience

Thomas Willis first introduced us, in the mid 1600s, to the idea that damage to the brain could influence behavior and that the cerebral cortex might indeed be the seat of what makes us human. Phrenologists expanded on this idea and developed a localizationist view of the brain. Gall's interesting approach Phrenology is a theory of human behavior based upon the belief that an individual's character and mental faculties correlate with the shape of their head. He has a story with Napoleon, check [that](https://www.thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/pdf_articles/phrenology.pdf).

Patients like those of Broca and Wernicke later supported the importance of specific brain locations on human behavior (like language -> [Broca's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area), [Redefining the role of Broca's area](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1414491112)). Ramón y Cajal, Sherrington, and Brodmann, among others, provided evidence that although the microarchitecture of distinct brain regions could support a [localizationist](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=80190) view of the brain, these areas are interconnected. 

*Note that: Ramón y Cajal is considered by many to be the father of modern neuroscience for his pioneering research.*

Soon, scientists began to realize that the integration of the brain’s neural networks might be what enables the mind. At the same time that neuroscientists were researching the brain, psychologists were studying the mind, with its thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and so forth. Out of the philosophical theory of empiricism came the idea of [associationism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/associationist-thought/): that any response followed by a reward would be maintained, and that these associations were the basis of how the mind learned. Associationism was the prevailing theory for many years, until Hebb emphasized the biological basis of learning, and Chomsky and Miller realized that associationism couldn’t explain all learning or all actions of the mind.

Neuroscientists and psychologists both reached the conclusion that there is more to the brain than just the sum of its parts, that the brain must enable the mind--but how? The term cognitive neuroscience was coined in the late 1970s because the fields of neuroscience and psychology were once again coming together. Neuroscience was in need of the theories of the psychology of the mind, and psychology was ready for a greater understanding of the working of the brain. The resulting marriage is cognitive neuroscience.

#### The Instruments of Neuroscience

Electroencephalography, Measuring Blood Flow in the Brain, Computerized Axial Tomography, Positron Emission Tomography and Radioactive Tracers, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging are the advances in technology and the invention of these methods have provided cognitive neuroscientists the tools to study how the brain enables the mind. I will extend these intruments when the book provide me more information in Chapter Methods of Cognitive Neuroscience.

### Structure and Function of the Nervous System

The nervous system is composed of two main classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the basic signaling units that transmit information throughout the nervous system. Glial cells serve various functions in the nervous system, providing structural support and electrical insulation to neurons and modulating neuronal activity. The central nervous system (CNS) has three main types of glial cells: astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes [see as figure](https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/aberrant-astrocytes-may-lead-parkinsons-other-neurodegenerative-diseases/). 

#### Glial Cells

Astrocytes ([Astrocytes: biology and pathology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2799634/), [Astrocytes: Role and Functions in Brain Pathologies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.01114/full)) are large glial cells with round or radially symmetrical forms; they surround neurons and are in close contact with the brain’s vasculature. The astrocytes create a barrier, called the blood–brain barrier (BBB), between the tissues of the central nervous system and the blood. The BBB restricts the diffusion of microscopic objects (such as most bacteria). 

Glial cells also form the fatty substance called myelin in the nervous system. In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes ([Oligodendrocytes: biology and pathology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2799635/)) form myelin; in the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells carry out this task. Myelin is a good electrical insulator, preventing loss of electrical current across the cell membrane. It increases the speed and distance that information can travel along a neuron.

Microglial cells ([Microglial cell origin and phenotypes in health and disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3086)), which are small and irregularly shaped, are phagocytes that devour and remove damaged cells. Unlike many cells in the central nervous system, microglial cells can proliferate even in adults (as do other glial cells). <br/>

#### Neurons

The standard cellular components found in almost all eukaryotic cells are also found in **neurons** (as well as in glial cells). A cell membrane encases the cell body (in neurons, it is sometimes called the soma; Greek for “body”), which contains the metabolic machinery that maintains the neuron: nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and other common intracellular organelles. The two predominant cellular components unique to neurons are the dendrites and the axon. 

**Dendrites** are branching extensions of the neuron that receive inputs from other neurons. They have many varied and complex forms, depending on the type and location of the neuron. Most dendrites also have specialized processes called *spines*, little knobs attached by small necks to the surface of the dendrites, where the dendrites receive inputs from other neurons.

The **axon** is a single process that extends from the cell body. This structure represents the output side of the neuron. Electrical signals travel along the length of the axon to its end, the axon terminals, where the neuron transmits the signal to other neurons or other targets. Transmission occurs at the *synapse*, a specialized structure where two neurons come into close contact so that chemical or electrical signals can be passed from one cell to the next. Some axons branch to form *axon collaterals* that can transmit signals to more than one cell.

Along the length of the axons, there are evenly spaced gaps in the myelin; these gaps are commonly referred to as **nodes of Ranvier**. <br/>

-------

### Neuronal Signaling

Neurons receive, evaluate, and transmit information. These processes are referred to as ***neuronal signaling*** ([Neuronal Signaling: an introduction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7377261/), [see neuronal signaling as figure](https://www.drawittoknowit.com/course/physiology/glossary/cellular-anatomy-physiology/neuronal-signaling)). Within a neuron, information moves from input synapses to output synapses through changes in the electrical state of the neuron caused by the flow of electrical currents within the neuron and across its neuronal membrane. Between neurons, information transfer across synapses is typically mediated chemically by *neurotransmitters* (signaling molecules); these synapses are called *chemical synapses*. At *electrical synapses*, however, signals between neurons travel via transsynaptic electrical currents.

Most neurons are both *presynaptic* and *postsynaptic*: They are **presynaptic** when their axon’s output synapses make connections onto other neurons or targets, and they are **postsynaptic** when other neurons make a connection at input synapses onto their dendrites or elsewhere on the receiving neuron. 

The voltage difference across the neuronal membrane in the resting state is typically about -70 millivolts (mV) inside, which is known as the *resting potential* or **resting membrane potential** ([figure](https://jackwestin.com/resources/mcat-content/plasma-membrane/membrane-potential)). This electrical-potential difference means that the neuron has at its disposal a kind of battery; and like a battery, the stored energy can be used to do work—signaling work. 

The membrane is peppered with transmembrane proteins, some of which serve as conduits for ions to move across the membrane. These proteins are of two main types: ion channels and ion pumps. Ion channels, as we will see, are proteins with a pore through the center, and they allow certain ions to *ow down their electrochemical and concentration gradients. Ion pumps use energy to actively transport ions across the membrane against their concentration gradients—that is, from regions of low concentration to regions of higher concentration.

The ion channels of concern to us—the ones found in neurons—are selective for sodium, potassium, calcium, or chloride ions (Na, K, Ca, and Cl, respectively). The extent to which a particular ion can cross the membrane through a given ion channel is referred to as its **permeability**. 

#### Take-Home Messages from Writers
* Glial cells form myelin around the axons of neurons. Myelin enables the rapid transmission of action potentials down an axon and increases the distance over which transmission can occur.
* Neurons communicate with other neurons and cells at specialized structures called synapses, where chemical and electrical signals can be conveyed between neurons.
* The electrical gradient across a neuron’s membrane results from the asymmetrical distribution of ions. The electrical difference across the membrane is the basis of the resting potential, the voltage difference across the neuronal membrane during rest (i.e., not during any phase of the action potential).
* Ion channels, formed by transmembrane proteins, can be either passive (always open) or gated (open only in the presence of electrical, chemical, or physical stimuli).
* Synaptic inputs result in postsynaptic potentials, and current to flow in the postsynaptic neuron.
* Postsynaptic currents can depolarize the axon hillock region, generating an action potential.
* Action potentials are all-or-none phenomena: The amplitude of the action potential does not depend on the size of the triggering depolarization, as long as that depolarization reaches the threshold for initiating the action potential.
* Nodes of Ranvier are the spaces between sheaths of myelin where voltage-gated Na1 and K1 channels are located and action potentials occur.
* Postsynaptic potentials lead to action potentials but also can be measured from large populations of neurons by electrodes located some distance away, such as the scalp, as when the oscillatory signals in an electro- encephalogram (EEG) are being recorded.

-------

### Synaptic Transmission
Neurons communicate with other neurons, with muscles, or with glands at synapses, and the transfer of a signal from the axon terminal of one neuron to the next neuron is called *synaptic transmission*. There are two major kinds of synapses—chemical and electrical—each using very different mechanisms for synaptic transmission.

#### Chemical Transmission
Most neurons send a signal to the cell across the synapse by releasing chemical neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, the gap between neurons at the synapse. The general mechanism is as follows: the arrival of the action potential at the axon terminal leads to depolarization of the terminal membrane, causing voltage-gated "Ca" channels to open. The opening of these channels triggers small vesicles containing neurotransmitter to fuse with the membrane at the synapse and release the transmitter into the synaptic cleft. 

There are two types of postsynaptic receptors: ligand-gated ion channels where neurotransmitter binding directly gates (opens) the ion channel, and G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) where biochemical signals indirectly cause the gating of ion channels; G proteins are those that bind the guanine nucleotides GDP and GTP (guanosine di- and triphosphate) and act as molecular switches in cells. Specific neurotransmitters bind to each type of postsynap-tic receptor. In ligand-gated ion channels, binding induces a conformational change in the receptor.

## Diary

### Day 1-2
I completed the course "Philosophy and the Sciences: Introduction to the Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences". It's relatively short and superficial course. They cover the main concepts of brain evolutionary theory and consciousness. After explaining the fundamentals of ideas, they mostly provide external resources for further information. 

### Day 3-6
I started course "Medical Neuroscience". Dr. White is pretty nice teacher, in first week he starts with the long introduction of the course. He recommends Neuroscience 6th book for further information. (It seems really hard to read for me, but anyway, we are in the path.)

I continued my research to find convenient resources for myself to start cognitive neuroscience. I will be updating [Resources](#resources) with my progress.

-----------
I will not be able to share some links due to copyrights, but I will be writing some of the notes I took in the [Notes](#notes) section.

-----------

In the second part of week one, he starts "Neuroanatomy". Frankly, I feel pretty awkward watching this course. We haven't been studying anything biological since we started university, and the language barrier with medical terms puts an extra burden on it. Still, I can say that I understand 60-70% of what is being said, Dr. White explains the topics really well. I completed the week one with lots of questions.

I must say that the course "Medical Neuroscience" is started as one of the most difficult course I have ever taken. However, this difficulty does not reduce my interest, on the contrary, I am even more curious. I research the parts that I think I need to research and leave the rest because some topics are too deep and need to be looked at again later.</br>

I read "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" until page 40s. Then read "Neuroscience 6th" only 5 pages (it took me 2.5 hours to read 5 pages???). I realized that I need to work Neuroscience calmly and without ruining the order. The discipline of neuroscience gives me a much more settled feeling than programming.</br>

I skipped over "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" and started to "Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind". Well, I won't continue to skip. I did this because the second book is much more up-to-date and recommended. I read the holy book "Neuroscience" 10 pages with lots of dictionary checking, searching for unknown biological and medical terms. I understand "patience" is the key...</br></br>


### Day 7
Off-day for cognitive neuroscience.

### Day 8 
I spoke with my professor at the university, who has a PhD in neuroscience. He gave some advice, and I talked to so many people at university today. Couldn't find the time to work.

### Day 9-11
I continue the book Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind. Their explanations of the topics are clear, and they provide several experiments and stories to make it more deducible.

### Day 12-13
I learned about the nervous systems. It recalled knowledge that I already have at high school. It is really strange feeling tho. When I was in high school, I was thinking and grumbling like "all of these informations are useless and we will never use". Of course, there are some stuff I see the first time. However, some of the new information were like I have always wondered, but have never made research about it. This chapter (Structure and Function of the Nervous System) is quite satisfying and full of useful information to fill spaces in the mind. I guess this chapter is one of the most technical one, and I think I will be even more enjoyed in other chapters.

### Day 14-18
Off-days for cognitive neuroscience. I am working on 3 different research projects, so I needed to be focused on others. Worked on signal processing and eye-tracking.

### Day 19
I started watching and completed first week of course "Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life". It is lightweight version of Medical Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroscience book. Actually, in this case I repeated same topics for 3 or 4 times from different resources without realising. Anyway, in my opinion it is important to repeat these main vocabulary of neurobiology and cognition to take it in the long-term memory and you can use the same order which is 1) watching course "Medical Neuroscience", 2) reading book and stuff about Cognitive Neuroscience, 3) watching course "Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life". I started feel the knowledge, but also see I still have quuiite looong way to go.

### Day 20-21
I started signal processing for neuroscience, Mike X Cohen's book "Analyzing Neural Time Series Data Theory and Practice" and videos. I am still making literature review for eye-tracking for programming. In 1990, [How do we read algorithms? A case study.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/48797) proposed the analysis of data collected from eye movement to investigate the cognitive process of programmers, based on theories that linked eye fixation to comprehension to understand how programmers read and understand algorithms. I do my research about extraction features of comprehension state from eye-tracking outputs.

### Day 22
Today was the first productive day of my new program. I realised that I cannot keep up with the lots of new knowledge and research projects without restrict plan, so I made one. 

I continued through medical neuroscience course. I finished the part of Cerebral Cortex, Brainstem and Blood Supply, and it was really hard to keep up with. I spent a fair amount of time understanding the locations of the arteries and the brain regions they supply, however, quiz was really hard to pass. I read the part of CNS, and Blood Supply and the Brain from Cognitive Neuroscience book. I watched the next videos of Mike X Cohen's and I start feel to really really enjoy this process. Even though it is painful, I can feel that I learn actual science. I read Mike Cohen's book on signal processing and analysis and repeated what he explained in the videos.

### Day 23-29
Well, in this period, I studied like an actual nerd. I am also reading the book "atomic habits", so I got some tips to organize my study routine and its effectiveness :) 

Here below is the my current daily routine which I think its quite nice to practice topics over and over again and progress in a solid way. <br/> ( You can feel the knowledge in your veins ): <br/>
1) [5AM - 6AM] -> Reading casual totally normal human book <br/>
2) [6.15AM - 7.30AM] -> Watching Medical Neuroscience or The Neurobiology of Everyday Life course videos <br/>
3) [8AM - 9.30AM] -> Reading/studying Cognitive Neuroscience book <br/>
4) [10AM - 11.30AM] -> Watching neural signal processing and analysis videos <br/>
5) [12 - 1PM] -> Reading/studying neural signal processing book <br/>
6) [2PM - 5PM] -> Flexible duties (job/other research projects etc.)
7) [6PM - 7PM] -> Reading/studying neural signal processing book <br/>

I realized that all materials I study are supporting each other. Neuroanatomy is the most hard topic for me right now, and it definitely requires lots of repetition on same topics to memorize exact location of each nerves, brain regions and functions of whole complex structures. Thus, I think this study plan is quite effective.
