# Cognitive Neuroscience

I'm keeping this repository for those who are afraid to start neuroscience or something else because it seems dark, comprehensive, and complex, even though it interests them a lot. I'm at the same point, and let's see how far we can go with self-discipline.

## About my passion
As can be easily seen, I have no past work with neuroscience. However, it has been my dream for a long time to explore the brain, understand cognitive processes and contribute something to this field. To prepare for this, I tried to isolate and improve myself at points that crossed my field at university. For example, computer vision and natural language processing. As a long term goal, using what I learned from this process, I will develop artificial intelligence-based projects with having clear understanding of the neuroscience domain's problems and needs. While I think that deep learning and new technologies can play an important role in the discovery of the brain, I rolled up my sleeves to learn traditional methods as well.

## About this repository
In this repository, you will find the resources I have found up-to-date, what I am reading, what I plan to read and what I have learned in a certain order.

## Resources
### Books
1) Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind {2019} <br/>
(Edit: -> After some research, I jumped on this book because it is much more up-to-date, easy to read, and recommended.)</br>
2) Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience {2012} <br/>
(Note: It's also easy to read, it simplifies very complex topics. Good book. I didn't read it all, I skipped over it.)</br>
3) Neuroscience 6th Edition {2018} <br/>
(Note: Pretty hard to read, best to go with the main course. Best medicine for its patient.)
### Courses
Courses to comprehend what is happening.</br>
1) [Philosophy and the Sciences: Introduction to the Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy-cognitive-sciences/) 
2) [Neurobiology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurobiology) </br>
3) [Medical Neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience) (Course is given by Leonard E. White, Ph.D. who is also one of the writers of Neuroscience 6th Edition.) </br><br/><br/>

## Notes
*Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences* is a short course that provides fundamental theories. They share lots of additional reading sources, I will be adding later.
