# Cognitive Neuroscience

I'm keeping this repository for those who are afraid to start neuroscience or something else because it seems dark, comprehensive, and complex, even though it interests them a lot. I'm at the same point, and let's see how far we can go with self-discipline.

## About my passion
As can be easily seen, I have no past study on neuroscience. However, it has been my dream for a long time to explore the brain, understand cognitive processes and contribute something to this field. To prepare for this, I tried to improve myself in subjects related to my field at university. For example, computer vision and natural language processing. As a long term goal, using what I learned from this process, I will develop artificial intelligence-based projects with having clear understanding of the neuroscience domain's problems and needs. While I think that deep learning and new technologies can play an important role in the discovery of the brain, I rolled up my sleeves to learn traditional methods as well. I wake up every day with a different excitement for the new things I will learn because there are lots of unknown things that I want to solve, which is very interesting and I like in this field. How the brain works is simply fascinating.

## About this repository
In this repository, you will find the resources I have found up-to-date, what I am reading, what I plan to read and what I have learned in a certain order.

## Resources
### Books
1) Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind {2019} <br/>
(Edit: -> After some research, I jumped on this book because it is much more up-to-date, easy to read, and recommended.)</br>
2) Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience {2012} <br/>
(Note: It's also easy to read, it simplifies very complex topics. Good book. I didn't read it all, I skipped over it.)</br>
3) Neuroscience 6th Edition {2018} <br/>
(Note: Pretty hard to read, best to go with the main course. Best medicine for its patient.)

## Notes

### Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences
*Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences* is a short course that provides fundamental theories. They share lots of additional reading sources, I will be adding later. Some links that I find useful for philosophy of the topic:
- [Evolutionary Psychology](https://iep.utm.edu/evol-psy/)
- [Evolution of Language](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/)
- [Niche Construction](https://nicheconstruction.com)

- [Spreading the Joy? Why the Machinery of Consciousness is (Probably) Still in the Head](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/spreading-the-joy-why-the-machinery-of-consciousness-is-probably-)
#### Summary of key points
- According to evolutionary psychology, evolutionary pressures would most likely produce a ‘modular’ mind.
- Language most likely developed through a combination of biological and cultural evolution.
- It is often unclear what "consciousness" means, and we should be careful when using colloquial terms like "consciousness" in science.
- The scientific study of consciousness is concerned with several different phenomena, including attention, wakefulness, and phenomenal experience itself, which are not always connected.

**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** is quite good resource.
#### Computational theory of mind and connectionism

- [Embodied Cognition](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/)
- [McGeer and Passive Dynamic Bipedal Walking (short video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOPED7I5Lac)
- [Cornell robots: all are autonomous, use little or no power and can't stand with parallel legs](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/robots/)
#### Summary of key points
- Cognition doesn't have to be just "in the head" - cognitive processing can be supported or complemented by bodily and environmental resources.
- Simple behaviors (like moving around an environment) are often driven by perception and don't necessarily require something like a clear plan or goal.
- When we take into account the role played by our cultural and linguistic environment, 'bodily' explanations of computing can scale up to higher (human) cognition.

## Diary

### Day 1
I completed half of the course "Philosophy and the Sciences: Introduction to the Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences". It's relatively short and superficial course. They cover the main concepts of brain evolutionary theory and consciousness. After explaining the fundamentals of ideas, they mostly provide external resources for further information. 


### Day 2
I completed rest of the course Philosophy and the Sciences: Introduction to the Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences.

### Day 3 
I started course "Medical Neuroscience". He is pretty nice, in first week he starts with the long introduction of the course. He recommends Neuroscience 6th book for further information. (It seems really hard to read for me, but anyway, we are in the path.)

I continued my research to find convenient resources for myself to start cognitive neuroscience. I will be updating [Resources](#resources) with my progress.

I will not be able to share some links due to copyrights, but I will be writing some of the notes I took in the [Notes](#notes) section.

### Day 4 
In the second part of week one, he starts "Neuroanatomy". Frankly, I feel pretty awkward watching this course. We haven't been studying anything biological since we started university, and the language barrier with medical terms puts an extra burden on it. Still, I can say that I understand 60-70% of what is being said, Dr. White explains the topics really well. I completed the week one with lots of questions.

I must say that the course "Medical Neuroscience" is started as one of the most difficult course I have ever taken. However, this difficulty does not reduce my interest, on the contrary, I am even more curious. I research the parts that I think I need to research and leave the rest because some topics are too deep and need to be looked at again later.</br></br>

### Day 5
I read "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" until page 40s. Then read "Neuroscience 6th" only 5 pages (it took me 2.5 hours to read 5 pages???). I realized that I need to work Neuroscience calmly and without ruining the order. The discipline of neuroscience gives me a much more settled feeling than programming.</br></br>

### Day 6
I skipped over "Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience" and started to "Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind". Well, I won't continue to skip. I did this because the second book is much more up-to-date and recommended. I read the holy book "Neuroscience" 10 pages with lots of dictionary checking, searching for unknown biological and medical terms. I understand "patience" is the key...</br></br>

> I will create another section for the review of the books and topics in it.
